    # Example of a complex SQL query that benefits from 1024 tokens
    complex_query = '''Let me think through this step by step:

STEP 1: ANALYZE THE QUERY
- I need to find customers who have both checking and savings accounts
- This requires analyzing the customers and accounts tables
- I need to use subqueries to find customers with each account type

STEP 2: EXAMINE THE SCHEMA
- customers table: id, first_name, last_name, email, branch_id
- accounts table: id, customer_id, type, balance, branch_id
- The relationship is: customers.id = accounts.customer_id

STEP 3: PLAN THE QUERY
- Use subqueries to find customers with checking accounts
- Use subqueries to find customers with savings accounts
- Use AND condition to find customers with both
- Use DISTINCT to avoid duplicates

STEP 4: WRITE THE SQL
Here's the complete SQL query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email, c.phone
FROM customers c
WHERE c.id IN (
    SELECT customer_id 
    FROM accounts 
    WHERE type = 'checking' AND status = 'active'
)
AND c.id IN (
    SELECT customer_id 
    FROM accounts 
    WHERE type = 'savings' AND status = 'active'
)
ORDER BY c.last_name, c.first_name;
```

This query will:
- Find all customers who have both checking and savings accounts
- Only include active accounts (status = 'active')
- Return customer names, email, and phone
- Sort results alphabetically by last name, then first name
- Use DISTINCT to prevent duplicate customer records

The query uses subqueries with IN clauses, which is efficient for this type of filtering.'''
