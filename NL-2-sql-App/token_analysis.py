This query will return customers who have both checking and savings accounts. Let me explain the logic:

The query uses subqueries to find customers who have accounts of type 'checking' and also have accounts of type 'savings'. This is a common pattern in SQL for finding records that meet multiple criteria.

The DISTINCT keyword ensures we don't get duplicate customer records, which could happen if a customer has multiple checking or savings accounts.

The ORDER BY clause sorts the results alphabetically by last name, then first name, which is a common way to present customer lists.

This type of query is useful for:
- Customer segmentation
- Marketing campaigns
- Account analysis
- Compliance reporting

The performance of this query depends on:
- Indexes on customer_id and type columns
- Number of accounts in the database
- Query optimization by the database engine

For better performance, you might consider:
- Adding indexes on (customer_id, type)
- Using EXISTS instead of IN for large datasets
- Partitioning the accounts table by type

The query assumes:
- Account types are stored as 'checking' and 'savings'
- Customer IDs are consistent across accounts
- No NULL values in customer_id or type columns

This is a standard pattern that works well for most relational databases including:
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- SQL Server
- Oracle
- SQLite (which this appears to be)

The query is safe and follows SQL best practices for:
- Readability
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Portability

I hope this explanation helps you understand the query structure and logic.
